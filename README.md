# Automatic plant watering system

## Introduction
This project aims to build an automatic plant-watering system using Arduino. The system comprises a moisture sensor, and when dry soil is detected, the system will water the plant until optimal soil moisture is achieved. The moisture status is visible on an LCD. The system can also be built as a stand-alone circuit.

## Hardware used
Arduino Uno <br />
LCD display 16x2 + I2C <br />
Pump, DC 3-6 V, 120 l/h<br />
Arduino soil moisture sensor, 3.3 - 5 V<br />
Relay 1-channel, 5V, 250 VAC, 10A<br />
other - tube, a battery holder 4xAA, wires ... <br />


## Software used 
Arduino IDE <br />
